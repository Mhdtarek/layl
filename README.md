# Layl

See the "app" in action at https://layl.app or get it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navedislam.layl) (it's a simple TWA). 

This is a re-write in Svelte of https://github.com/mr-islam/layl (which was written by a total JS/React beginner).

Lots of credit to Batoul Apps for their awesome project [Adhan](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js), which Layl happily relies upon.

## License

GPL v3 for the codebase, but all rights reserved for the images and art. 

## Localization

Layl would love to support more languages. If you know a language and would like to help translate Layl to it, please let me know and I'll help you get started inshaAllah! Layl only has a little bit of text :D

For developers, you can clone this repo and I recommend using VS Code with [this extension](https://github.com/antfu/i18n-ally). Layl uses svelte-i18n.

## Development

I work on this as a hobby during my freetime, so my full effort & focus goes to actual updates that benefit *users* and thorough bug-testing. Thus I don't usually work on documentation, though I try to make commit messages useful and use GitHub issues and projects to encourage community collaboration. 
 
Please contact me if some code is unclear, or if you would like to contribute so we can discuss ideas. I would be more than happy to update the project plans or code documentation as soon as there are people interested in contributing‚Äîuntil then, I'm full-focus on actual improvements üëç. 

**Scripts** are in `package.json`, pretty clear I think.
