# Layl

See the "app" in action at https://layl.app or get it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navedislam.layl) (it's a simple TWA). 

This is a re-write in Svelte of https://github.com/mr-islam/layl (which was written by a total JS/React beginner).

Lots of credit to Batoul Apps for their awesome project [Adhan](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js), which Layl happily relies upon.

## Development

I work on this as a hobby during my freetime, so my full effort & focus goes to actual updates that benefit *users* and thorough bug-testing. Thus documentation and the issues board on GitHub are not updated regularly.
 
Please contact me if some code is unclear, or if you would like to contribute so I can share development plans. I would be more than happy to update the project plans or code documentation as soon as there are people interested in contributing‚Äîuntil then, I'm full-focus on actual improvements üëç. 

Scripts are in `package.json`, pretty clear I think.
